# Todo CLI Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development Only
All changes and features must originate from an approved specification in `/specs_history`. Never implement code without a corresponding spec, plan, and tasks breakdown. Use iterative refinement: specs → plan → tasks → implement → test/review.

### Clean Code & Best Practices
Write readable, maintainable Python code following PEP 8 and PEP 257. Use meaningful variable/function/class names (descriptive, snake_case). Include docstrings for all modules, classes, functions, and methods (Google or NumPy style). Use type hints everywhere (Python 3.13+ features encouraged where beneficial). Keep functions short and single-responsibility; avoid deep nesting. No duplicated code; refactor ruthlessly.

### Project Structure
All source code lives in `/src`. Modular design: separate concerns (e.g., `task.py` for Task model, `storage.py` for in-memory store, `cli.py` for command-line interface, `main.py` as entrypoint). Use `__init__.py` to make `/src` a package if needed. No code in root except configuration files.

### Technology Constraints
Python version: 3.13+ exclusively. Dependency management: UV only. No requirements.txt unless generated by UV. Zero external dependencies for Phase I (use only Python standard library). In-memory storage only (list/dict); no file I/O, databases, or persistence.

### Functionality & Behavior
Tasks must have: unique auto-increment ID (starting from 1), title (str), description (str), completed status (bool). CLI must be interactive loop-based (e.g., menu or command parser like argparse/cmd). List view must show ID, status indicator ([ ] or [x]), title, and truncated description. All operations must handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., ID not found → clear error message). No GUI; console-only output.

### Quality Assurance
Include basic unit tests in `/tests` (using unittest or pytest if added later). Code must be deterministic and crash-free for valid inputs. Prioritize user experience: clear prompts, helpful messages, confirmation for destructive actions (delete/update).

## Documentation & Repo Standards
README.md must include: project overview, UV setup instructions, run command, feature demo (screenshots or text examples). All specs preserved in `/specs_history` with timestamps/names. Commit messages: descriptive, imperative mood.

## Additional Constraints
None specified beyond the core principles.

## Governance
All specifications, plans, tasks, and code generated by the AI agent (Qwen) must strictly adhere to these rules. Violations must be rejected and corrected.
